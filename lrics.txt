"Never to a change, never to a chance Never know what's coming in"
Never try to knew, always in a blur Thinking if I'm gonna fall
I don't know why I used to think that I could fly
Every second time is running and it's gonna fly Sitting on the horse ride looking at the summer sky
Every time I wander what I'm thinking every night
When I was younger I never wanna go home tonight
Should I tell the rest, tryin' something new Before everything just flew
Things I left and said, never not forget On the stage of for a time
I don't know why I used to think that I could fly
Every second time is running and it's gonna fly Sitting on the horse ride looking at the summer sky
Every time I wander what I'm thinking every night
When I was younger I never wanna go home All my years of living I'm still taking this in road
It's the road of living I'm just never giving up
Feeling optimistic every time I'm feeling down
When I was younger I never wanna go home tonight
I don't know what I want or I need or believe
I just want to live life and survive in this time
Window shot curtains down Silence now getting loud
Thinking of floating clouds, mysteries now unfyled
Every second time is running and it's gonna fly Sitting on the horse ride looking at the summer sky
Every time I wander what I'm thinking every night
When I was younger I never wanna go home All my years of living I'm still taking this in road
It's the road of living I'm just never giving up
Feeling optimistic every time I'm feeling down
When I was younger I never wanna go home tonight
